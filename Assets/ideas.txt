* force player to stand still when using scanner mayube
* variable buffer size
* other speed ups, maybe point generation code and such, still maybe dont do one element at a time etc
* make the randomness equal to half the spread amount between eac hcell 
* i dont like how sin cos makes the super scanner go over the area twice
* superscan points end up more frequently on edges, prob due to math
* since introducing the ability to do many points (not uploadSlow anymore) there is a bug where we go past the buffers index possiblity
* think of new things to add
start out as horror-puzzle. eventually unlock the outside, where colors of points match the objects, paint and see beautiful worlds as your reward
as for the horror aspects, when you scan enough of a "red", instantly more points are unlocked on the body a loud sound should play
* think about making the player move with physics instead... pro: makes it easier to move thru destroyed blocks, cons it makes it harder to see with lidar since old points will litter scene more
for village level: door into house, to unlock something outsie, which leads to a drop down tunnel, go down, there is a room, wet water drops
add footsteps sounds, depending on surface type
omg, if I call drawCircles UploadCircleData from two different places... they can overwrite each other. fuck
zombie sound gets overriden somehow when doing scan

maybe temporarily disable the scanner after having destroyed other points
do something with the camera lens too 
points moving around in space somewhát?= crazy shader effects(prefereably in the next level, dont do everything at on´ce)

make the court level be orthograhpic. (or not, maybe after, or not) 
just remember to make the court room activate differently, right now the zombie thing is just a temp
court room again, should be harder to activate, but once it does, a tunnel should open up behind the elevated thing... and since it's a tunnel... you can use the kiki song. 
when you leave the room into the tunnel, door behind you should close
turn off sounds when going to next level
tunnel should be long, but kept visually interesting somehow. audiosources should replenish along the way.
