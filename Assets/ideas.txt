* force player to stand still when using scanner mayube
* variable buffer size
* other speed ups, maybe point generation code and such, still maybe dont do one element at a time etc
* make the randomness equal to half the spread amount between eac hcell 
* i dont like how sin cos makes the super scanner go over the area twice
* superscan points end up more frequently on edges, prob due to math
* since introducing the ability to do many points (not uploadSlow anymore) there is a bug where we go past the buffers index possiblity
* think of new things to add
